For this Individual Project, you will use the entity you selected for your Unit 3 discussion, along with the research you conducted for that assignment, to present a report totaling 600–800 words. The report will be on the overall effectiveness of that entity’s online presence and will have recommendations for improvement.

Using this <a href="http://resources.careered.com/LCMSFileSharePreview/Resources/MSWordDocument/ENGL105_U4_IP_Template_1702A.docx" rel="nofollow">Unit 4 Individual Project Template</a>, complete the following for this assignment:

<ol>

 <li><strong>Research review:</strong> In 1–2 paragraphs, provide a summary of your findings on the importance of having an online and social media presence for ANY company, organization, or governmental agency. Use information from the 4 sources you chose for Unit 3, ensuring that there is at least one APA style in-text citation for each of those 4 sources in the Research Review section. You will be summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing these sources to provide a background for your analysis and suggestions. This section focuses on why having an online presence is important for companies and organizations rather than on the entity you are analyzing in the following sections.</li>

 <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> In 3–4 paragraphs, analyze your entity’s existing social media presence and existing Web site, addressing each of the following components:

  <ul>

   <li>Provide an explanation of your entity’s target audience.</li>

   <li>Discuss the entity’s purpose(s) for using social media.</li>

   <li>Provide an overview of the various social media sites the entity currently uses.</li>

   <li>Discuss how often this company posts updates on these sites.</li>

   <li>Describe areas where the entity is effective in its approach to social media.</li>

   <li>Discuss the strengths of the entity’s Web site.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li><strong>Recommendations and conclusions:</strong> In 2–3 paragraphs, discuss specific identified areas where your entity could improve. Consider the following suggestions:

  <ul>

   <li>Suggest the addition of more platforms to attract its target audience, offering specific guidance on which platform(s) should be added and why.</li>

   <li>Suggest how a specific platform should be used differently, including why its use needs to change.</li>

   <li>Suggest a different cadence of posts to the various platforms. For example, is the entity posting too rarely or too often? Include a specific breakdown of how often posts should be made and why.</li>

   <li>Offer suggestions for ways to gain more followers. Be specific on which strategies are more effective for which platforms.</li>

   <li>Offer suggestions for how to improve the entity’s Web site, and address the benefits of making these improvements.</li>

   <li>Finally, conclude your report by informing your audience of how taking your suggestions will benefit them in the long run, supporting these claims with outside sources.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li><strong>References page:</strong> Create a references page that cites all the references used in this report. Use APA formatting. You should have a minimum of 4 cited sources, at least 2 of which must have come from the CTU Library.
